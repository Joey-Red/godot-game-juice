[rainbow]==========   Fixed issues ==========[/rainbow]
	
- Projectile only shoots straight, not up/down.
[x] Projectile Now Shoots where aiming (vertically)

- Sword only swings straight, not up and down
[x] Sword now can be aimed vertically.


- Need to create a player spawner, and remove the script attached to Main level
[x] done

- Work on Simple Enemy AI, Animations, etc. how smart?
[x] have enemy ai that follow,

- Enemy AI - when player dies, they do not retarget.
[x] They now retarget

- TODO: make Sure player has no control after death until respawn.
[x] WASD disabled, added death animation so mouse control is fine ig.

- maybe add death/respawn screen
[x] Added death fade out, respawn fade in, button to respawn etc.


- Enemies facing backward, was in the middle of giving them animations, meshes (pcked scnee)
[x] Enemies now have a rotation, you can flip them in the 'EnemyStats' sub resource. 
[x] Can easily create new enemies
[x] animations done (kind of shit but they work for now)

- flying enemies - need to figure out ground/air hitbox .. .something something collision layers
[x]Flying and ground enemies now have proper working hitboxes.

- Make enemies allow additional animationplayers / skeletons
[x] Can now use any skeleton/animationplayer. need to put PROPER animationplayer on 'xxxx_base.tscn' then in the 'Real_Enemy'
[x] need to link animations to states under enemy stats resource, can also modify animation speed.

- I think enemies are respawning - so max of 5, but everytime you kill them they respawn  ? 
[x] so every kill means max enemies goes up by 1 (unintended.)
[x] fixed, silly. dummyenemy.gd has auto respawn variable that was true, 
[x] probably should only be true if you are hitting a practice dummy or testing something.


- Maybe add slide mechanic, or if we go forward with beardo maybe like a roll or something.
	[x] done


- ENEMY AI: right now they just follow, super basic. 
	[x] Add enemy state 'wander' or something, 	when theyre not in combat or running at player. 	to look more natural and stuff.
